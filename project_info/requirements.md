1. User Authentication & Profile Integration
 - GitHub Sign-In: The system must allow users to log in securely using their existing GitHub credentials.

 - User Context Input: The system needs a mechanism for users to input their current academic standing (e.g., age or year in university) to establish a baseline for comparison. 

2. Data Aggregation & Metrics
 - Activity Tracking: Retrieve commit history, pull requests, and code reviews for a certain amount of time.
 
 - Repository Analysis: Analyze repository data, specifically the number of repositories and languages used.

 - Skill Profiling: The tool needs to identify the user's primary programming languages (e.g., frontend vs. backend) to determine their current technical strengths and where they have room ofr improvement.

3. AI-Powered Recommendations
 - Benchmarking system: Create and compare against an average baseline relevant to the users experience level.

 - Gap Identification: The AI must identify gaps in the user's profile, such as a lack of backend skills if they primarily use frontend languages, or a low volume of repositories.

 - Actionable Suggestions: The system must generate specific, relevant tasks for the user, such as new project ideas or specific technologies to learn, to improve their standing.
